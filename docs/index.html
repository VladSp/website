        <h2>Information</h2>
        
        <p align="justify">The Online International Mathematical Cup is an annual contest organised by a group of mathematics enthusiasts, olympians, and professors, with the help of the Romanian Mathematical Society and GIL Publishing House. This initiative arose from the passion for problem-solving and the desire to collaborate with other math lovers.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="justify">The contest is primarily intended for advanced high school and middle school students, but everyone is welcome to participate, regardless of age or experience. It is divided into the senior category and the junior category, which resemble the difficulty and structure of the IMO and the USA(J)MO, respectively. </p>
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Regulationss</h2>
        <p align="justify">The examination consists of two papers: the first day and the second day. Each paper has three problems, arranged in ascending order of difficulty. The problems are marked from zero to seven points, for a total of forty-two points. Contestants have four and a half hours to solve the problems and write down their solutions.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="justify">Each contestant must work independently; outside communication is prohibited during the examination. The only instruments permitted in the contest are writing and drawing instruments, such as rulers and compasses. In particular, books, calculators and computers are not allowed.</p>
